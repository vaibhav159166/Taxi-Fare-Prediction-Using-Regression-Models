# Taxi-Fare-Prediction-Using-Regression-Models
<h3><b>Business Objective:</b></h3>
<p>To predict taxi fares based on historical data and other relevant features, helping taxi services optimize pricing, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency.</p>

<h3><b>Maximize:</b></h3>
<p>Business profitability through accurate pricing predictions and enhanced customer service by predicting fares in advance.</p>
<h3><b>Data Pre-processing:</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Cleaning: Removing outliers and handling missing values in fare data, geographical features, and timestamps.</li>
            <li>Feature Engineering: Creating features like distance, time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, etc., to improve model performance.</li>
            <li>Temporal Analysis: Extracting patterns from time-related data, such as rush hour trends, weekend effects, and seasonal variations.</li>
        </ul>
<h3><b>Models Built:</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Random Forest Regression:</b> An ensemble method for predicting fares based on multiple input features, handling non-linearity effectively.</li>
            <li><b>Linear Regression:</b> A simple yet effective method for modeling the relationship between taxi fare and key variables.</li>
            <li><b>Lasso Regression:</b> A regularization technique that enhances the linear regression model by reducing the complexity and avoiding overfitting.</li>
        </ul>
<h4><b>Time Series Models:</b></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):</b> A baseline model for forecasting taxi fares based on historical fare data.</li>
            <li><b>SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):</b> An extension of ARIMA that takes into account seasonal variations in taxi fare data.</li>
            <li><b>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):</b> A deep learning model designed to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in the time series of taxi fares, especially useful for forecasting future fares.</li>
        </ul>

    
<h3><b>Impact of Project:</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Efficient Fare Prediction:</b> Taxi services can provide more accurate fare estimates, leading to improved customer trust and satisfaction.</li>
            <li><b>Optimization of Pricing Strategy:</b> Dynamic pricing models can be developed based on real-time predictions, boosting profitability while maintaining customer loyalty.</li>
            <li><b>Operational Efficiency:</b> By predicting future fare trends, taxi services can plan better for demand surges, driver allocation, and vehicle management.</li>
        </ul>
